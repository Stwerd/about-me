          <div>Biography</div>
          <div>I was born and raised in the city of Maple Valley. I grew up witha completly normal life, I rode my bike and played the trumpet. I spent a lot of my time growing up in band or on the robotics club.When I graduated I tried college for a few months before I moved onto the Coast guard. It was cold, wet, and for six months out of the year, I spent it looking out at sea. The things that made this experience not miserable were my friends and my girlfriend. Since I've gotten out, I worked for a month at a security company, a year delievering medicine for Mary bridge in Tacoma, and now here at Codefellows.</div>
